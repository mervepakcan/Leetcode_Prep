        "The grid is traversed, and a **Depth-First Search (DFS)** is performed from each potential starting cell that matches the first character of the target word.\n",
        "\n",
        "At every step, the algorithm verifies whether the current cell corresponds to the current character in the word.\n",

        "If a match occurs, all **four neighboring directions (up, down, left, right**) are explored recursively.\n",
        "\n",
        "The process continues until the entire word is matched or all possibilities are exhausted.\n",
        "\n",

        "1.Define a recursive function backtrack(i, j, k) where\n",
