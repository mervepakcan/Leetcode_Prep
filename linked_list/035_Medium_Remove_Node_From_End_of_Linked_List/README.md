Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], n = 2

Output: [1,2,3,5]

Example 2:

Input: head = [1], n = 1

Output: []

Example 3:

Input: head = [1,2], n = 1

Output: [1]
 

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the list is sz.
1 <= sz <= 30
0 <= Node.val <= 100
1 <= n <= sz
 

Follow up: Could you do this in one pass?
